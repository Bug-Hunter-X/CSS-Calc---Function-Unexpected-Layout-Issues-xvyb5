To address this, you might need to ensure the calculation happens after the parent's width is determined.  A common solution is to use JavaScript or a CSS framework's layout engine which handles this. But, often, simply restructuring your code to avoid mixed units is better.  For instance, using only percentages or only pixels in your calculations is a way to avoid the problem.

```css
/* Solution using only percentages */
.container {
  width: 48%; /* Approximate 50% - 10px */
  margin-left: 1%;
  margin-right: 1%;
}

/* Solution using only pixels (requires knowing parent width or viewport width) */
.container {
  width: calc(50vw - 10px); /* Using viewport width */
}
```
Note:  The `vw` unit represents 1% of the viewport width. Using pixels only works well if you know the parent's width, and if not, then using `vw` is a good option.  Using only percentages, as the first example shows, is often a pragmatic approach.
